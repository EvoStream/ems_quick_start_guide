## License Installation
**Note:** You should already have your license file available. If none, EvoStream offers a **30-day free trial** license to those who want to explore the features of EMS. Click [here](https://evostream.com/free-trial/) to avail the free trial or contact [salesupport@evostream](mailto:salessupport@evostream.com) for other license type purchase.

There are two options for installing the license file: **manual** or via **Web UI**.

### A.	Manual

Copy the `License.lic` file to `..\EvoStream\config`.



### B.	Via Web UI

1\. Run the EMS (direct launch after installation) or using the desktop shortcut.

  ![qsgfw10.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/qsgfw10.jpg)

2\. Open the EMS Web UI by pointing your browser to

[http://localhost:8888/EMS_web_ui/index.html](http://localhost:8888/EMS_web_ui/index.html)

   ![qsgfw11.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/qsgfw11.jpg)

3\. Click **INSTALL EMS LICENSE**

4\. Locate the license file, and enter the directory where license will be installed

5\. Click **Install License**

   ![qsgfw12.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/qsgfw12.jpg)

6\. A message for successful installation will be displayed

7\. Restart the EMS

   ![qsgfw13.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/qsgfw13.jpg)

**Tip:** A successful EMS start will show GO! GO! GO! in console.





## Connecting to Telnet

To use EMS, a telnet is needed for communication. User needs to enable the telnet client to be able to run the EMS API commands.

1\. Open a command prompt, and run telnet

- For ASCII telnet interface  
  
  ``` 
  $ telnet localhost 1112
  ```
  
- For ASCII CLI interface  
  
  ``` 
  $ telnet localhost 1222
  ```

A telnet localhost will be opened after pressing Enter key.

2\. For preliminary check, type:  

``` 
version
```

The result for ASCII CLI is shown below:

## Basic EMS API

### A.	Adding a Stream

The pullStream command is the simplest command to get an external stream.

Sample command:  

``` 
pullstream uri=rtmp://s2pchzxmtymn2k.cloudfront.net/cfx/st/mp4:sintel.mp4 localstreamname=test
```



### B.	Stream Playback

Pulled streams are automatically saved in EMS. To play the pulled stream, use a media player that supports the media format that was pulled.

EMS automatically converts the stream pulled in different protocols so no worries if you want to play the stream using an RTMP or RTSP protocol for example.

To play in media player:

1\. Go to Open Network Stream

2\. Enter the URL of the pulled stream

``` 
rtsp://127.0.0.1:5544/test
rtmp://127.0.0.1/live/test
```

The EMS will fetch the pulled stream via localStreamName and playback will start once the file is found.

Please refer to **EMS_User's_Guide** and **EMS_API_Definitions** for more information.



### C.	Stopping the EMS server

If the user wants to shut down the EMS, just send the command:

``` 
shutdownServer
```

The EMS will respond with a key:

![qsgfw16.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/qsgfw16.jpg)

Then send another shutdownserver command using the key:

``` 
shutdownServer key=bVjvUo8HQ6VzDFJv
```

The EMS will shut down after sending the command.
